## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project initialization with Zig 0.16.0 pinned in `.zig-version` (ADR-013).
- Full architecture specification in `spec/`:
  - Architecture overview, manifest, non-goals, coding style, invariants.
  - Kernel Interface (KI) with frozen operation numbers (ADR-003, ADR-004).
  - Subsystem specs: graphics, input, timer, memory, runtime.
  - Milestone roadmap M0–M8 with quality metrics (ADR-015).
  - Verification pipeline and bootable-commit rule (ADR-016).
  - Debugging Survival Guide.
- Architecture Decision Records ADR-001..ADR-020:
  - Evolutionary SASOS, single address space Ring 0, stable interfaces.
  - Renderer layer, generic runtime API, Lua 5.4 vendored, event loop.
  - Minimal rendering primitives, no filesystem yet, wasm3 later, Limine.
  - Zig version pinning, deterministic build, measure every milestone.
  - Bootable commit, concurrency model M7, Ring 3 KI transport.
  - Bootloader gate, future extensibility (new KI modules).

### Milestone M0 — Boot

- `build.zig`: `zig build` produces a bootable ISO, `zig build run` boots it in QEMU,
  `zig build iso` assembles the Limine ISO, `zig build test` runs host tests.
- Kernel boots from Limine (long mode, serial, GOP framebuffer), prints `ASTER BOOT OK`.
- Boot handoff translated to kernel-owned `BootInfo` (ADR-019).
- Vendored toolchain: Limine 12.5.2 (binaries + protocol header + host tool),
  Lua 5.4.8 source.
- `tools/qemu-smoke.sh` (serial marker + timeout, fast FIFO exit) and
  `tools/bench.sh` (measurement of boot time and image size).
- Deterministic build verified: same commit + same Zig = identical kernel hash
  (ADR-014). Kernel image 12.0 KB (target < 64 KB).
